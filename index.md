# About the project

Escoria was created by Ariel Manzur during the development of [The Interactive
Adventures of Dog Mendonça and Pizza
Boy](https://store.steampowered.com/app/330420?snr=5000_5100__) (Okam Studios),
a point and click adventure game in the style of LucasArts and Sierra games.

The project was released under MIT licence and is since then in continuous
development by its community of developers and users.

# Features

Escoria features all of the required elements to create a 2D point and click
game to help game developers to focus more on the story they wish to tell, more
than on coding the classical mechanisms of the genre. 

- Player control
- Dialog trees
- Inventory and items combinations
- Sound management
- Camera controls
- Saving and loading games and settings
- Plugins for controls and UI

Escoria was designed to be no barrier to the desired style of the game. Connect
Escoria to your scenes by using then provided Escoria nodes for rooms, player,
items, terrain, inventory and so on.

## ASHES scripting langage 

Escoria comes with a tailor-made scripting langage to control the game:
events, dialogs, cut-scenes, sound and many other commands are all defined
there. They can even be called from GDScript scripts.

And the best part of it: you can easily extend the langage with your own custom
commands!

## Complete documentation

Escoria team worked hard to provide a full documentation of the project. It
features a complete description of methods, nodes, and also a walkthrough
tutorial to help you start.

# About the name

Escoria means "scumm" in spanish. The name was chosen as a wink to the
well-known SCUMM engine created by Ron Gilbert (LucasArts entertainment).
